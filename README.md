# Calculate Discount

This repository contains a Python program that solves the following quiz:

**Task**  
Create a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price after applying a discount.  
- The function should take the original price (`price`) and the discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters.  
- If the discount is **20% or higher**, apply the discount to the price.  
- Otherwise, return the original price unchanged.

**Program Flow**  
1. Prompt the user to enter the original price of an item.  
2. Prompt the user to enter the discount percentage.  
3. Use the `calculate_discount` function to determine the final price.  
4. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount is applied, print the original price.
